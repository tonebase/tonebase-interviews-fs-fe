# tonebase Technical Interview - FullStack (Front-End Focus)

Welcome to the tonebase Technical Interview! Congratulations, if you're here it means we think you'd make a great addition to the team, based on your past experience, personality and kick-ass skills!

This interview is a small/short test of those skills. Ideally the questions presented and the challenges involved should take no more than 1 hour for an experienced full-stack developer with React chops.

The initial portion of this interview is simply answering a few technical, front-end and React based questions. We can talk through these on a call as I'd love to hear how you think about them/through them!

#### Types of Questions

This interview has been created for someone who considers themselves a full-stack developer with a focus on the front-end. Very concretely what we mean by this is you feel comfortable spinning up an express server and handling MVC based routes, controlles and middleware... but you really feel at home diving into some React or Vue code and ironing out cross-browser bugs and optimizing SCSS patterns. Or you feel comfortable everywhere, which is even better :)

Okay, with all that out of the way let's dive into the question section!

### 1. What made you interested in/choose React as a framework? Was it a choice you made? Regardless, what is the one thing you enjoy most about it compared to other frameworks you've used and what is one thing you dislike about it?
/* I was introduced to React through an online course I had taken awhile back on Udemy, after designing and developing websites in HTML, CSS & Javascript I became very interested in the idea of component based frameworks and sought out React after speaking with several developer friends and learning more about its increasing popularity.  After diving in, the html style syntax of JSX made it super easy to use and so I latched onto it immediately.  Even now, after toying around with Angular and Vue, React is still my preferred library because it's less heavy than Angular which can often perform a little slower when comparaed to React's render time and virtual dom.  And even though Angular is its own suite of tools and integrates better with typescript, I still prefer and enjoy taking advantage of React's third party tools such as router, redux for centralizing state, the incorporation of React Hooks in v16.8 and also because I find it easier to use with dynamic rendering technologies such as Next.js.

### 2. Why do the component names in JSX start with capital letters?
The main reason why component names in JSX start with capital letters is because it indicates a react component and furthermore get compiled in direct reference to the named variable. Under the hood, the syntax would be 'React.createElement(component, props, ...children). If it were to start with a lowercase letter, then React treats it as a regular html element and passes it as a string into React.createElement(..), and so no methods inside the class get called, nothing renders and the user will not see any error messages inside the browser console.

### 3. What are the main types of components you can render in React? When do you choose one over the other?
There are two main types of components that you can render in React: functional and class. Originally, class components were prioritized when declaring/accessing state and implementing lifecycle methods.  HOWEVER, with the addition of React hooks, functional components now have access to state and lifecycle methods, as oppose to their original intention of simply rendering information on the screen.  Using functional components with React hooks helps maintain consistency with a functional programming paradigm by making logic more concise and avoiding a shared state through the reusability of stateful logic. 

### 4. How much experience do you have with testing frameworks? While our testing is light at the moment (read: nonexistent) this is something we'd like to move to in the future so this is a 'nice-to-know' for us!
During the last product I worked on called Portara, I streamlined all of our product's testing using Jest with Enzyme to test rendering of React components and integrated it with Travis CI to ensure codebase integrity and prevent merge conflicts as well as facilitate continuous integration and deployment of our application.  I have since adapted this framework, adding both unit and integration tests to test all of our latest products and releases.

Whew, okay, now moving into a couple of code questions. We don't need you to code anything just yet, but this is more around optimization and undertstanding JS/React.

### 1. What is wrong with this example, and how would you go about fixing or improving the component?

```
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: this.props.name || 'Anonymous'
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <p>Hello {this.state.name}</p>
    );
  }
}
```

### 2. What's the issue with this component. Why? How would you go about fixing it?

```
class App extends React.Component {
state = { search: '' }
handleChange = event => {
/**
     * This is a simple implementation of a "debounce" function,
     * which will queue an expression to be called in 250ms and
     * cancel any pending queued expressions. This way we can
     * delay the call 250ms after the user has stoped typing.
     */
    clearTimeout(this.timeout);
    this.timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      this.setState({
        search: event.target.value
      })
    }, 250);
  }
render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <input type="text" onChange={this.handleChange} />
        {this.state.search ? <p>Search for: {this.state.search}</p> : null}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Onto just a teensy bit of code + introducing you to our system! This part can be done on your own, and you can ping me when it's good to go!

Here is a link to a Github repo. containing our NextJS setup. It includes everything already setup for you -- SCSS support, a blank canvas for you to play with, and all the boileplate out of the way.

[The Github Repo.](https://github.com/tonebase/tonebase-interviews-fs-fe)

**Your challenge is to implement ONE of the following:**

1. OPTION 1: Implement a simple counter
  
  For this assignment you may use a state management system of your choice (other than the native React state). We recommend `react-easy-state` as that is our default tool and is extremely simple to get up and running.

  The counter should:

  (a) Increment UP once per hour between 9AM and 5PM (inclusive)

  (b) Increment DOWN once per hour between 6PM and 8AM (inclusive)

  (c) Increment UP when a button is clicked manually

  (d) Increment DOWN when a different button is clicked manually


2. OPTION 2: Build the Google homepage (www.google.com)

  Open-ended, go into as much or as little detail as makes sense to you. Responsiveness, functionality, modularity, etc. is all up to you -- we want to know how you interpret this prompt. Feel free to get as creative or keep it as simple as you would like. Your code will be evaluated along the following criteria:
  - Functionality
  - Creativity
  - Readability
  - Cleanliness
  - Comments
  - Modularity
  - Defensiveness
  - Declarative-ness


**When Complete**

When you're good to go with your implementation and/or happy with it feel free to make a P.R. into this repo. under a new branch titled `${ YOUR_NAME--FullStack--FrontEnd }`

Lastly, just a bit of writing! We are a company where members of the team are constantly shifting around/traveling, whether to China to manage our upcoming subsidiary there, or to New York and Europe to head productions, attend events, etc.

Thus writing, and the ability to write clearly, logically and to formulate arguments and answers is crucial at tonebase, whether a developer, PM, or A&R manager! These questions aim to give us a better understanding of you as a writer, as well as your development skills.

### 1. Tell me about componentWillMount and the issues with it?

### 2. Can you walk me through the cycle of mounting a stateful component? What functions are called in what order? Where would you place a request for data from the API? Why?

### 3. If you had unlimited time budget and could fix / improve / change one thing in your last project, what would it be and why?

---

That's it! Now it's your time -- feel free to ask any questions you may have and we'd love to answer to the best of our abilities. Thank you so much for taking the time to do this quick interview - we can't wait to see your answers and see if there's a way for us to work together!

At tonebase we truly believe in the following principles:

1. To Educate & Inspire In Everything We Do
1. Think Big, Then Think Bigger
1. Align Around The Mission, Execute Against The Vision
1. Start And End With The Customer
