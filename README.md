# tonebase Technical Interview - FullStack (Front-End Focus)

Welcome to the tonebase Technical Interview! Congratulations, if you're here it means we think you'd make a great addition to the team, based on your past experience, personality and kick-ass skills!

This interview is a small/short test of those skills. Ideally the questions presented and the challenges involved should take no more than 1 hour for an experienced full-stack developer with React chops.

The initial portion of this interview is simply answering a few technical, front-end and React based questions. We can talk through these on a call as I'd love to hear how you think about them/through them!

#### Types of Questions

This interview has been created for someone who considers themselves a full-stack developer with a focus on the front-end. Very concretely what we mean by this is you feel comfortable spinning up an express server and handling MVC based routes, controlles and middleware... but you really feel at home diving into some React or Vue code and ironing out cross-browser bugs and optimizing SCSS patterns. Or you feel comfortable everywhere, which is even better :)

Okay, with all that out of the way let's dive into the question section!

### 1. What made you interested in/choose React as a framework? Was it a choice you made? Regardless, what is the one thing you enjoy most about it compared to other frameworks you've used and what is one thing you dislike about it?
-->I have prior experience with AngularJS on introduction with React I found the later easier to learn and more modular. I have not worked with React on large scale projects to explore enough and dislike.

### 2. Why do the component names in JSX start with capital letters?
-->To differentiate JSX elements from normal HTML elements that start with lowercase letters.

### 3. What are the main types of components you can render in React? When do you choose one over the other?
-->Functional (stateless) and Class(statefull) components. If the component does not need to maintain its state or lifecycle its better to use functional components as they easier to define, read, debug and may also be faster.

### 4. How much experience do you have with testing frameworks? While our testing is light at the moment (read: nonexistent) this is something we'd like to move to in the future so this is a 'nice-to-know' for us!
-->I have used QUnit before for defining and testing JavaScript code.
---

Whew, okay, now moving into a couple of code questions. We don't need you to code anything just yet, but this is more around optimization and undertstanding JS/React.

### 1. What is wrong with this example, and how would you go about fixing or improving the component?

```
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: this.props.name || 'Anonymous'
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <p>Hello {this.state.name}</p>
    );
  }
}
-->In this snippet:
name: this.props.name || 'Anonymous'
defines a default value 'Anonymous' for the state 'name'. This can get cumbersome to use if used in many places.
The better way would be to use 'defaultProps'

class App extends React.Component {
	...
	name: this.props.name
	...
}
App.defaultProps = { name: 'Anonymous'}```

### 2. What's the issue with this component. Why? How would you go about fixing it?

```
class App extends React.Component {
state = { search: '' }
handleChange = event => {
/**
     * This is a simple implementation of a "debounce" function,
     * which will queue an expression to be called in 250ms and
     * cancel any pending queued expressions. This way we can
     * delay the call 250ms after the user has stoped typing.
     */
    clearTimeout(this.timeout);
    this.timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      this.setState({
        search: event.target.value
      })
    }, 250);
  }
render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <input type="text" onChange={this.handleChange} />
        {this.state.search ? <p>Search for: {this.state.search}</p> : null}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```
-->There are 2 problems with the component:
1. the event handler is not bound to the component instance so this.timeout is not recognised. It can be fixed as:
constructor(props) {
    super(props);
	this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
}
2. event.target.value is not accessible in function passed to setTimeout(). this can be fixed by adding a local variable in the event handler and using this in the anonymous function passed to setTimeout()
const s = event.target.value;
this.timeout = setTimeout(() => {
  this.setState({
    search: s
  })
}, 250);

Onto just a teensy bit of code + introducing you to our system! This part can be done on your own, and you can ping me when it's good to go!

Here is a link to a Github repo. containing our NextJS setup. It includes everything already setup for you -- SCSS support, a blank canvas for you to play with, and all the boileplate out of the way.

[The Github Repo.](https://github.com/tonebase/tonebase-interviews-fs-fe)

**Your challenge is to implement ONE of the following:**

1. OPTION 1: Implement a simple counter
  
  For this assignment you may use a state management system of your choice (other than the native React state). We recommend `react-easy-state` as that is our default tool and is extremely simple to get up and running.

  The counter should:

  (a) Increment UP once per hour between 9AM and 5PM (inclusive)

  (b) Increment DOWN once per hour between 6PM and 8AM (inclusive)

  (c) Increment UP when a button is clicked manually

  (d) Increment DOWN when a different button is clicked manually


2. OPTION 2: Build the Google homepage (www.google.com)

  Open-ended, go into as much or as little detail as makes sense to you. Responsiveness, functionality, modularity, etc. is all up to you -- we want to know how you interpret this prompt. Feel free to get as creative or keep it as simple as you would like. Your code will be evaluated along the following criteria:
  - Functionality
  - Creativity
  - Readability
  - Cleanliness
  - Comments
  - Modularity
  - Defensiveness
  - Declarative-ness


**When Complete**

When you're good to go with your implementation and/or happy with it feel free to make a P.R. into this repo. under a new branch titled `${ YOUR_NAME--FullStack--FrontEnd }`

Lastly, just a bit of writing! We are a company where members of the team are constantly shifting around/traveling, whether to China to manage our upcoming subsidiary there, or to New York and Europe to head productions, attend events, etc.

Thus writing, and the ability to write clearly, logically and to formulate arguments and answers is crucial at tonebase, whether a developer, PM, or A&R manager! These questions aim to give us a better understanding of you as a writer, as well as your development skills.

### 1. Tell me about componentWillMount and the issues with it?
-->componentWillMount is not idealplace to fetch data as it may not return before the first render call and thus causing the component to be loaded without the data.


### 2. Can you walk me through the cycle of mounting a stateful component? What functions are called in what order? Where would you place a request for data from the API? Why?
-->There are three phases : Mounting calls constructor, render (updates DOM), componentDidMount
Updating calls render (updates DOM), componentDidUpdate, 
Unmounting calls componentWillUnmount
Best place for a data request would be componentDidUpdate as it ensures that the component's initial render is done and the component state can be updated.
### 3. If you had unlimited time budget and could fix / improve / change one thing in your last project, what would it be and why?
-->My last project was a game development project in Unity. One of the issues that was dropped beacuse of time constraint was the glitch in player and camera proximity. Given more time I would like to improve that because that was one of the most basic yet prominently visible glitches that spoiled both the functionality and the user experience.
